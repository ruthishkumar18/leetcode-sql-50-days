# Day 1 — Recyclable and Low Fat Products

This problem asks us to find all product IDs where:
- The product is **low fat**
- The product is **recyclable**

We use the `Products` table with the following columns:
- `product_id`
- `low_fats` (Y/N)
- `recyclable` (Y/N)

We need to return only the product IDs that satisfy both conditions.
