# Day 2 — Find Customer Referee

We are given a table called Customer with columns:
- id
- name
- referee_id

The task is to return the names of customers who are:
1. Not referred by anyone. (referee_id is null)
2. Referred by a customer whose id is not equal to 2.

The final result can be in any order.
