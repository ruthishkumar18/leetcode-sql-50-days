# Day 10. Average Time of Process per Machine

We are given an Activity table that tracks when a machine starts and ends a process.

Each process has:
- a start time
- an end time

The task is to calculate the average time taken by each machine to complete its processes.
The result should show machine_id and the average processing time rounded to 3 decimal places.
