# Day 11. Employee Bonus

We are given two tables.

Employee table contains employee details like empId, name, supervisor, and salary.  
Bonus table contains bonus information for some employees.

The task is to find employees who either:
- have a bonus less than 1000
- did not receive any bonus

We need to return the employee name and bonus amount.
