# Day 12. Students and Examinations

We are given three tables.

Students contains student_id and student_name.  
Subjects contains subject_name.  
Examinations contains student_id and subject_name for exam attendance.

Each student takes every subject, but may attend the exam zero or more times.

The task is to count how many times each student attended each subject exam.
The result should be ordered by student_id and subject_name.
