# Day 14. Confirmation Rate

We are given two tables.

Signups table contains all users who signed up.  
Confirmations table contains confirmation requests made by users.

The confirmation rate is calculated as  
number of confirmed messages divided by total confirmation requests.

If a user has no confirmation requests, the confirmation rate should be 0.
The result should be rounded to two decimal places.
