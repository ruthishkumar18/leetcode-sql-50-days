# Day 19. Queries Quality and Percentage

We are given a Queries table that stores query results, their position, and ratings.

Definitions  
- Query quality is the average of rating divided by position.  
- Poor query percentage is the percentage of queries with rating less than 3.

The task is to calculate these two metrics for each query_name.
All results should be rounded to two decimal places.
