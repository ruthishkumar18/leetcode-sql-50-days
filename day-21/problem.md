# Day 21. Immediate Food Delivery II

We are given a Delivery table that stores order dates and preferred delivery dates.

An order is called:
- immediate if order_date equals customer_pref_delivery_date
- scheduled otherwise

The first order of a customer is the order with the earliest order_date.

The task is to find the percentage of immediate deliveries among all first orders.
The result should be rounded to two decimal places.
