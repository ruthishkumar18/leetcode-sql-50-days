# Day 23. Number of Unique Subjects Taught by Each Teacher

We are given a Teacher table that stores teacher_id, subject_id, and dept_id.

A teacher can teach the same subject in different departments.
We need to count how many unique subjects each teacher teaches.

The result can be returned in any order.
