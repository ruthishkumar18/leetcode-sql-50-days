# Day 30. The Number of Employees Which Report to Each Employee

We are given an Employees table that stores employee details and their reporting manager.

A manager is defined as an employee who has at least one direct report.

The task is to report:
- employee_id of the manager
- name of the manager
- number of direct reports
- average age of the direct reports rounded to the nearest integer

The result should be ordered by employee_id.
