# Day 31. Primary Department for Each Employee

We are given an Employee table that stores employee and department details.

An employee can belong to multiple departments.
If an employee belongs to only one department, that department is considered primary.
If an employee belongs to multiple departments, the one with primary_flag = 'Y' is the primary department.

The task is to return each employee with their primary department.
