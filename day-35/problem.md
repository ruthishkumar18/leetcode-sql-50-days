# Day 35. Last Person to Fit in the Bus

We are given a Queue table that stores people waiting to board a bus.

Each person boards the bus based on the turn order.
The bus has a maximum weight limit of 1000 kg.

The task is to find the name of the last person who can board the bus without exceeding the weight limit.
