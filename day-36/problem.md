# Day 36. Count Salary Categories

We are given a bank Accounts table. Each row represents an income value for an account.

We must count how many accounts fall into three salary categories:
- Low Salary: income < 20000
- Average Salary: income between 20000 and 50000 (inclusive)
- High Salary: income > 50000

The output must include all three categories, even if the count is zero.
