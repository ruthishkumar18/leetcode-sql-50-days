# Day 38. Exchange Seats

We are given a Seat table where each student is assigned a seat id.

The ids are continuous starting from 1.
We need to swap the seat id of every two consecutive students.

If the total number of students is odd, the last student should not be swapped.
The result must be ordered by id.
