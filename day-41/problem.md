# Day 41 — Friend Requests II: Who Has the Most Friends

We are given a table where each row represents a friendship between two users:
- requester_id
- accepter_id

A single row means both users are friends with each other.  
We need to count the number of friends each user has and return the user with the maximum count.

The test cases guarantee that only one user will have the highest number.
